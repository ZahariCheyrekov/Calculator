# About this project 

I'm pretty happy about this project. I really like how it looks and how I made it. The colors are great and they go well together. They are not too boring and also not too shiny. Decided to use css flex-box model for positioning the body. 

```css
body {
    font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;
    background-color: rgb(0, 233, 231, 0.2);
    width: 100vw;
    height: 100vh;
    display: flex;
    justify-content: center;
    align-items: center;
    overflow: hidden;
}
```

The grid layout was used for the buttons section and it went pretty good.
